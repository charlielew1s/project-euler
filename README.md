## Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository.

The solutions to each completed Project Euler problem can be found in the (solutions)[] folder.
Each problem has its own javascript file that can be run with the command: node ./problemX.js
Each file contains the description of the problem commented above a single function that can be run to find the solution.
